The title of my mini project is online **_Sport store_**, where customers allowed to choose liked shoes, add them to cart, and finished their transaction by ordering products. Every user can **_register_** in this site, and all their information will be stored in **_customers table_**.  After registration customer can **_login_** or **_logout_** every time as he wish. After logging in every customer has own cart(basket) where they can hold liked item. After all this stuff he finally can order choosed products from cart, and he also can remove disliked items. All information while ordering like address, payment method etc. will be stored in **_orders table_**. Customers can write reviews, and add some picked pictures. (Here is where I add **_file uploading feature_** in this project). If customer is foreigner, he can **_switch languages_**, and choose the convenient one(kz, ru and en languages are available). If customer will have some complains or suggestions he can wrote it and send to us. And **_email sending feature_** works at this time.
